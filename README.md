# Literature Review on [Analog Computing in the Modern Era]

## Name: [Arian Tajvar]

### Summary
This literature review explores the possible resurgence of analog computing in the modern era, focusing on whether analog computers can become faster, more accurate, and applicable to general-purpose tasks. While analog computers were largely displaced by digital ones, recent developments in fields such as neuromorphic engineering and AI have revived interest. This review delves into potential applications, such as machine learning, optimization problems, and energy-efficient computing, while also examining the key challenges facing analog computing, such as precision and scalability.

### Exploration of the Question

**Question 1:**  
*Can modern analog computers surpass digital ones in certain applications?*

*Answer:*  
Analog computers excel in specific tasks, such as solving differential equations and simulating physical systems in real-time. While digital systems dominate due to their precision and programmability, hybrid analog-digital systems may offer advantages in energy efficiency and speed for specialized tasks like machine learning and optimization.

**Question 2:**  
*What applications could benefit from modern analog computing?*

*Answer:*  
- **Optimization problems:** Analog systems can solve real-time control problems and complex simulations more efficiently.
- **Machine learning and neural networks:** Analog circuits may accelerate certain machine learning processes with less energy consumption, especially in tasks requiring large datasets.
- **Energy-efficient computing:** Analog computing offers the potential for significantly lower power consumption than digital systems, which could be beneficial in areas like IoT devices and mobile computing. (For example, a source described how Honeybees may use a million times less energy for collision avoidance compared to a Tesla).

**Question 3:**  
*What are the main challenges for expanding analog computing?*

*Answer:*  
- **Precision issues**: Analog systems are prone to noise and imprecision, making them less reliable for tasks requiring high accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Analog systems are often designed for specific tasks, making them less versatile than digital computers.
- **Design complexity**: The complexity of designing analog circuits for general tasks is a major barrier.

### Influential Researchers

- **Carver Mead**: Pioneering work in neuromorphic engineering and analog VLSI design, integrating analog computing with brain-inspired architectures.
- **Said Hamdioui**: Professor at Delft University of Technology, researching memristor-based computing and its applications in analog computing for AI and machine learning.
